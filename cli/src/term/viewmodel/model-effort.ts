/**
 * The model picker's effort column: a per-row tier gauge adjusted with ←/→.
 *
 * Geometry is planned once for the whole visible page rather than per row, so
 * every gauge starts in the same column, every affordance lands in the same
 * column, and every tier label lines up under the one above it. A row whose
 * ladder is shorter than the widest one pads between its last cell and the right
 * affordance, which holds those columns steady while still showing honestly that
 * the model offers fewer tiers.
 *
 * The gauge cell must be Neutral width, not Ambiguous: a cell that draws wider
 * than the column it was measured for fuses into its neighbour and destroys the
 * ladder this module exists to draw. `←→` stay Ambiguous, matching the spelling
 * `key-hints` already ships, since they sit at a column edge where an extra
 * column costs nothing.

 * Gauge cell, and the ←/→ affordances on the focused row.

 * `◼` (U+25FC) rather than the obvious `■` (U+25A0), because `■` is East-Asian
 * **Ambiguous**: a CJK-configured terminal draws it two columns wide while
 * `visibleWidth` counts it as one. Each cell then overruns its own column and
 * butts against its neighbour, fusing the ladder into one solid bar — measured
 * in a real CJK terminal, where five cells rendered as a single unbroken run.
 * `◼` is Neutral width (one column in every locale), so cells stay discrete with
 * the hairline seam that makes the ladder readable. Devin uses the same glyph.
 *
 * Filled and empty are the *same* glyph, separated only by colour — measured
 * from Devin's rendering, where an unfilled cell is a solid `#444444` square,
 * not a hollow outline. One glyph keeps the pitch even; a hollow `□` would both
 * break that rhythm and read as a checkbox rather than an empty slot.
