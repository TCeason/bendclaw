//! Resolving a `provider:model` spec that was written by an earlier run.
//!
//! Sessions and scheduled tasks persist the model they run on. The catalog
//! underneath changes over time: a model moves between tiers, or the server
//! renames how it groups its providers. The stable identity is the model
//! id; the provider part is only where that id was served at save time.
//!
//! [`Config::resolve_model_spec`] stays strict so an interactive `--model`
//! still reports a typo. Anything read back from storage comes through here.
